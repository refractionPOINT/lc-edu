            <p>The Add-ons Marketplace enables LimaCharlie users to subscribe to various APIs, Lookups and Services at the click of a button.</p>
            
            <p>APIs are deep integrations and enable core capabilities, along with other superpowers that are close to the metal.</p> 

            <p>Services are lighter integrations and cover a wide range of uses. They can also be created as public or private by any LimaCharlie user (for fun or profit).</p>

            <p>Lookups are simply that: threat feeds, IP reputation, known bad hash lists - basically anything that can be represented as a dictionary. Can be used directly in detection and response rules logic.</p>

            <p>Add-ons are applied on a per tenant basis.</p> 

            <p>LimaCharlie's Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach can be used to create tenants with pre-configured Add-on configurations.</p>
