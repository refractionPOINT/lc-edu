            <h2>comms</h2>

            <h3>Cost: $0.50 / sensor / month</h3>

            <p>Comms is the place to respond to detections as a team. It's built close to the metal to give full visibility of the actions your team is taking to mitigate threats.</p>

            <p>When a detection happens, a Room is generated for your team to assign ownership, discuss, assess indicators of compromise, and issue commands. It's more than a paper trail - it's a digital war room.</p>
            
            <p>If decisive action is required without time to explain what needs doing, take the initiative and your team will see the process in real-time. An additional benefit of this is newer members more easily learning proper protocol by witnessing what a real-time investigation and response looks like.</p>
            
            <p>Rich linking of entities allows your team to observe trends across detections: like an endpoint with several detected threats, or a common detection popping up on several boxes. Navigate between them easily or merge rooms together to create a shared context for complex emerging issues.</p>
            
            <p>Whether it be for auditing, shift changeover, or onboarding, a quick search through Comms will let you pick up where the last user left off with ease.</p>

            <h2>cuttingedge</h2> 
            
            <h3>Cost: $0.30 / sensor / month</h3>

            <p>The Cutting Edge threat feeds are aggregated, filtered and augmented from a multitude of sources. Emphasis is put on timely Indicators of Compromise (IoC) for new and upcoming threats.</p>

            <h3>Usage</h3>

            <p>When enabled, the cuttingedge service will automatically apply a managed D&R ruleset to your organization which will then generate detections.</p>

            <p>Produced detections pre-empt investigation by including metadata about the origin of the IoC as well as the nature of the threat.</p>

            <p>A sentiment metric is available to help dial in alerting thresholds.</p>

            <h2>dumper</h2>
            
            <h3>Cost: Free</h3>

            <p>The Dumper service allows the dumping of several forensic artifacts on Windows hosts.</p>

            <p>It supports a single action, which is to dump. It supports multiple targets, memory to dump the memory of the host and mft to dump the MFT of the file sytem to CSV.
            The Service then automates the ingestion of the resulting dump (and dump metadata) to LimaCharlie's Artifact Ingestion system where it can be downloaded or analyzed, and where you can create D&R rules to automate detections of characteristics of those dumps.</p>
            
            <h3>Usage</h3>

            <p>When enabled, dumper will be added to the Service Request view inside your organization. It will accept the following parameters:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>sid - a sensor ID for the host to perform the memory dump</li>
                <li>retention (optional) - the number of days to retain the stored results</li>
            </ul>

            <p>On submission of a request, the dumper service performs a full memory dump of a host, uploads the resulting dumps to LimaCharlie's External Logs system, and deletes the local dumps afterwards.
            Dumper requests can also be made via D&R rules; check out the example service request for more details.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
            
            <p>The dumper service does not currently validate that the host has enough available disc space for the memory dump.</p>

            <p>Although the dumper service is free, the resulting memory dumps uploaded to LimaCharlie are subject to External Logs pricing.</p>

            <h2>exfil</h2>
            
            <h3>Cost: Free</h3>

            <p>Automates management of event selection for events from agents that should be sent to the cloud in real-time.</p>

            <p>By default, LimaCharlie sensors send events to the cloud based on a standard profile that includes events like NEW_PROCESS, DNS_REQUEST etc.</p>

            <p>If you enable the Exfil Service, this default profile is replaced by a custom set of rules you define.
            The rule customization is done in two parts:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>The Event Rules, which simply define a list of events that should be sent to the cloud based on platform and tags.</li>
                <li>The Watch Rules, which define additional events that should be sent to the cloud based on the content of each individual event.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The Watch Rules allow you to specify a platform and tag to select which sensors the rule applies to, plus these elements:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Event:</strong> the specific event type that should be evaluated, like MODULE_LOAD.</li>
                <li><strong>Path:</strong> the path within the event component whose value should be evaluated, like FILE_PATH.</li>
                <li><strong>Operator:</strong> the type of evaluation/comparison that should be done between the value at Path in the event and the Value.</li>
                <li><strong>Value:</strong> the value used in the comparison.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Usage</h3>

            <p>When enabled, the Exfil Control view will be available within your organization. From there you can change the default set of events to be sent for each sensor platform or you can use tags to create more targeted configurations.</p>

            <img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/limacharlie-io/addons/exfil_config.png"/>

            <p>With exfil it's also possible to turn off collection of all events, minimizing usage.</p>

            <p>It automates integrity checks of files & registry values through pattern-based rules. Specify which platforms or tagged sensors to monitor and expose new integrity events for writing detection rules against.</p>
            
            <h3>Usage</h3>
            
            <p>When enabled, the File/Reg Integrity view will be available within your organization. From there you can specify patterns to watch for on particular platforms, or you can use tags to create more targeted configurations.</p>

            <h2>sensor-cull</h2>
            <h3>Cost: Free</h3>

            <p>The sensor-cull service performs continuous cleaning of old sensors that have not connected to your organization in a number of days.</p>

            <p>This is useful for environments with cloud deployments or VM template based deployments that enroll sensors over and over.</p>

            <h3>Interacting</h3>

            <p>The sensor-cull service does not implement a web UI, but because of its simplicity all interactions, like managing rules can be done via the generic Service Request section of the web interface.</p>

            <p>The service works by creating rules that describe when various sensors should be cleaned up.</p>

            <p>Each rule specifies a single sensor tag used as a selector for the sensors the rule applies to. A rule also has a name which is helpful for bookkeeping, and a ttl which is the number of days a sensor can not connect to the cloud before it becomes eligible for cleanup.</p>
            
            <p>Cleanup is automatically applied once a day.</p>
