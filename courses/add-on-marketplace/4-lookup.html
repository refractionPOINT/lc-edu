            <p>Below is a list of the primary lookups currently available in LimaCharlie, but the list is always growing.</p>

            <h3>Cost: Free</h3>

            <p>Lookup of disreputable IPs according to the Open Threat Exchange (OTX) IP Reputation list.</p>

            <p>The OTX IP Reputation list is a valuable tool in a security researcher's arsenal. Unlike a Blocklist, which only provides a list of active offending addresses and/or domains, the Reputation List gathers historical data on the behavior of a given address or domain which can be used to weigh events for risk. The Reputation list factors in:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Historical Events</li>
                <li>Registration Data</li>
                <li>Geo-Location Data</li>
                <li>Previous known activity</li>
                <li>Activity data from other partner lists</li>
                <li>Current Pulse Data from OTX</li>
