            <h2>virustotal</h2>
           
            <p>VirusTotal is an online platform used to share potential malware samples and the related scan results from a multitude of Anti-Virus engines.</p>

            <h3>Setup</h3>

            <p>Set the VirusTotal API Key in the Integrations view within your organization, using the key provided by your VirusTotal account.
            Subscribe to this vt API add-on.</p>
            
            <h3>Usage</h3>

            <p>When enabled, you can use the VirusTotal API in the detection part of a D&R rule to match based on the number of Anti-Virus engines that have flagged a file hash as malicious.</p>
            
            <p>For example:</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/a95a5634cfc38d18c67de32eb89677e1.js"></script>

            <h2>ip-geo</h2>
 
            <p>The ip-geo functions as a lookup, using MaxMind to perform IP Geolocation data for matched events.</p>

            <h3>Usage</h3>
            
            <p>When enabled, you can use ip-geo as a lookup in the detection part of D&R rules.</p>

            <p>For example:</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/9d4b51596a31f21c6a5aa57774d412e4.js"></script>

            <p>This rule runs any incoming CONNECTED event against the api/ip-geo lookup resource. The metadata_rules are further detection rules that will apply to the metadata returned by a lookup match.</p>

            <p>The format of the metadata returned is documented here and looks like this:</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/90df4559021ae3b1cbfc790dd9e19cfc.js"></script>
