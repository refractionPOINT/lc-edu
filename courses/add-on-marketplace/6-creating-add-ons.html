            <h2>Creating an Add-on</h2>

            <p>Users can create their own add-ons and optionally share them in the marketplace.</p>

            <p>To create a new add-on, do it from the dashboard of LimaCharlie.io. When doing so, especially when marking the add-on as public, keep these in mind:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Fill in as many of the fields as possible.</li>

                <li>Make the purpose and usage of the add-on clear for users not aware of the capability.</li>

                <li>If the add-on requires a lot of background information, put it in the website link rather than the description.</li>

                <li>Your email address will be included in the add-on description, if you plan on publishing many rules you may want to create a limacharlie.io account specifically for this purpose.</li>

                <li>The platforms flags are not enforced but are a courtesy to the users to let them know where they can expect your add-on to work.</li>

                <li>Subscribers to your add-on will NOT have access to the exact implementation, this helps you protect specific Intellectual Property you may have, but it also means you need to be clear about the exact capabilities in your description and website.</li>

                <li>Add-ons remain your property, but may be evaluated and approved / dismissed due to quality or performance concerns. If you are not sure, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@limacharlie.io"> support@limacharlie.io</a>.</li>

                <li>If implementing a detection, include "filtering" of the relevant event types to what is strictly required for the detection, but avoid filtering on organization-defined labels as they change from organization to organization. If you do use labels, describe the exact usage in the description.</li>

                <li>Before making an add-on public, make sure to test it.</li>
            </ul>

            Keep in mind that creating an add-on does not immediatly grant organizations you're a member of access to it. After creating it, you must go in the organization you want to access it from, go to the Add-ons section and "subscribe" to your add-on. This will grant the organization access and then you can begin using it as part of D&R rules.
