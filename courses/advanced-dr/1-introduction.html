            <p>Welcome to Advanced Detection & Response (DR).</p>

            <p>This course is designed to build the strong foundation established in the course <a href="https://edu.limacharlie.io/courses/basic-detection-response" target="_blank">Basic Detection & Response</a>.</p>

            <p>At its most basic level DR is used to secure computational assets by monitoring <a href="https://doc.limacharlie.io/docs/documentation/docs/events.md" target="_blank">Events</a> for indicators of compromise (IoC). When an IoC is detected a response action is triggered. Response actions range from firing an alert to isolating the given host from the network.</p>

            <p>This course examines several advanced mechanisms available to the rule author in defending against advanced persistent threats and automating security operations.</p>

            <p>Any questions relating to this course, or LimaCharlie in general, can be directed towards <a href="mailto:answers@limacharlie.io">answers@limacharlie.io</a>.</p>
