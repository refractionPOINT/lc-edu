            <h2>Variables</h2>

            <p>It is possible to store some pieces of state on a per-sensor basis for the lifetime of a sensor (single boot). This state is called "variables". Variables have a name and a set of values associated with them. Values can be associated with a variable name at run-time using the add var (and del var) response.</p>

            <p>The add var action supports an optional ttl value which is the number of seconds the value should be set for, like ttl: 3600.</p>

            <p>Other rules may then use the values in a variable as part of the detection component.</p>

            <p>Like the "lookback" feature, variables can be used in the is, contains, starts with and ends with operators by surrounding the variable name with [[ and ]], like [[my-var]].</p>

            <p>For example, these rules looking for unsigned execution from external drives (like USB).</p>

            <p>First, add new external drives to a variable when they are connected:</p>

            <p>Second, look for unsigned execution starting on those drives:</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/edcf1554af18901e1f2288315f4ffdb8.js"></script>
