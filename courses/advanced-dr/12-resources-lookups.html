            <h2>Lookups</h2>

            <p>Creating a lookup add-on enables you to create a list that you can use as part of D&R rules. Once in place, you can refer to it using the op: lookup D&R rule with a reference to your add-on looking like resource: <code>lcr://lookup/my-lookup-name</code>.

            <ul>
                <li>Lookups support a few structures.</li>
                <li>Newline-separated values.</li>
                <li>JSON dictionary where keys are the elements of the lookup and the values are the metadata associated.</li>
                <li>YAML dictionary where keys are the elements of the lookup and the values are the metadata associated.</li>
                <li>OTX JSON Pulse.</li>
                <li>MISP JSON Feed.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Here is an example of this complex format:</p>
            
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/3a5aee9e4167eae799d045146030cec5.js"></script>
        
            <p>When uploaded, the data for the lookup can be provided in three different ways:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>As data literal in the upload API.</li>
                <li> As a URL callback, where your data is a URL like https://www.my.data.</li>
                <li>As an Authenticated Resource Locator (ARL) (the prefered method)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The maximum size of a lookup is 15MB through the REST API and 512KB through the web interface.</p>

            <h3>Optimized Format</h3>

            <p>Sometimes when creating a Lookup you may want to include right metadata for each element of the lookup, but the maximum size may be an issue. In cases where there is a lot of metadata repetion you may use an optimized format. This format will allow you to associate large pieces of metadata with a high number of lookup items.</p>

            <p>To accomplish this, you will need to split up your metadata from your lookup values like:</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/f3267d1c38ec833ee076cf7931151b12.js"></script>
            
            <p>The <code>_LC_METADATA</code> key has as a value a list of all the pieces of metadata you want to include.</p>

            <p>The _LC_INDICATORS is the normal list of indicators, but instead of having the metadata directly associated with each indicator as the value, it uses an integer that refers to the <code>_LC_METADATA</code> list's index where the metadata can be found.</p>

            <p>The above example is equivalent to the non-optimized:</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/bb09d10bd387dc232ba07e494ad6c566.js"></script>

            <p>As you can see, this optimization is useful to reduce the repeated metadata. This is particularly useful if, for example, you have large numbers of IoCs for a given actor. In that case every IoC in the lookup would be associated with the same metadata (information about the actor).</p>

            <strong>From MISP</strong>

            <p>When creating an add-on from MISP content, LimaCharlie expects the data to be a JSON document to have the following structure:</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/200a13bbae572c1a4af192237f07b08d.js"></script>
            
            <p>The MISP event above once ingested in LC will be transformed to a Lookup like:</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/feb780386988b8eaa90b3852490eebe7.js"></script>

            <p>LimaCharlie understand the MISP format regardless of how it is ingested. That said, the classic way of ingesting it would be to ingest the MSIP Events use an ARL on a MISP REST API with one of the supported ARL authentication types like basic.</p>

            <p>For example: <code>[https,misp.my.corp.com/events/1234,basic,myuser:mypassword]</code>.</p>

            <strong>Reference D&R Rules</strong>

            <p>To put a Lookup "into effect", you need a DR rule. The Lookup is a list of elements while the rule describes what you want to look for in that list.</p>

            <p>Below is a list of DR rules describing how to lookup various common Indicators of Compromise:</p>

            <p><strong>Hashes</strong></p>
