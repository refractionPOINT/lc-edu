            <p>DR rules are simply boolean expressions.</p> 

            <p>The logical construction of the detection component of a rule written in YAML might look something like this:</p>

            <script class="gist" src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/556249e33be7f008e470bdfbf21e4b5b.js"></script>

            <p>And if we look at a rule's nested structure we can see that they are actually more like boolean trees. The following tree represents the detection scaffold shared above.</p>

            </div>

            <p>DR rules are evaluated using an algorithm that follows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eulerian_path" target="_blank">Eulerian Path</a>. The path followed in the example given would evaluate op1, then op2, followed by the operators under the OR condition (op3 then op4).</p>

            <p>Re-arranging the order of operations in the example given would result in the operators being evaluated in a different order. The following example would produce an evaluation sequence that begins with the OR condtion starting with the operators underneath it (op3 then op4), followed by op1 and op2.</p>

            <script class="gist" src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/f7dcadc3803f89cff2cd5dcb53f1a009.js"></script>

            <p>And the equivalent boolean tree construction would look like this.</p>
