            <h2>False Positive Rules</h2>

            <p>The False Positive (FP) rules allow you to filter out detections (as generated by the report action). These rules apply globally across all namespaces and sources.</p>

            <h3>Use Cases</h3>

            <p>The typical use case for FP rules is to add exceptions from some detections that are cross-cutting (for example ignore all detections from a specific host), organization-specific exceptions (like ignoring alerts relating to a custom piece of software used in an organization), or suppressing errors from managed D&R rules you don't have direct access to.</p>

            <h2>Structure</h2>

            <p>An FP rule is structured with the same format at the detection component of a D&R rule. The main difference is that the rule applies to the content of a detection, as can be seen in the Detections section of the web app.</p>

            <p>Most stateless operators from the D&R rules are available in FP rules.</p>

            <h3>Examples</h3>

            <strong>Suppress a Specific Detection</strong>
            
            <p>Prevent a specific detection:</p>

            <strong>Ignore Detections for Specific File Name</strong>

            <p>Ignore any detection that relates to a file name in any path.</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/12453df4e585ca5d91f84627f423a08a.js"></script>

            <strong>Ignore Detections on a Specific Host</strong>

            <p>Any detection originating from a specific host will be ignore.</p>
