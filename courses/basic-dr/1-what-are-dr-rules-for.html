            <p>This course is designed to give you a strong foundation in the principles of Detection & Response (DR).</p>

            <p>At its most basic level DR is used to secure computational assets by monitoring events for indicators of compromise (IoC). When an IoC is detected a response action is triggered. Response actions rang from firing an alert to isolating the given host from the network. </p>

            <p>DR is also a way for automating many of the aspects of security operations.</p>
