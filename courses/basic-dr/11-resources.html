            <h2>Lookups</h2>

            <p>Creating a lookup add-on enables you to create a list that you can use as part of D&R rules. Once in place, you can refer to it using the op: lookup D&R rule with a reference to your add-on looking like <code>resource: lcr://lookup/my-lookup-name</code>.</p>

            <p>Lookups support a few structures.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Newline-separated values.</li>
                <li>JSON dictionary where keys are the elements of the lookup and the values are the metadata associated.</li>
                <li>YAML dictionary where keys are the elements of the lookup and the values are the metadata associated.</li>
                <li>MISP JSON Feed.</li>
            </ul>

           <p>Here is an example of this complex format:</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/3aeaf45479da27a03c34a5fbaaa49a1b.js"></script>

           <p> When uploaded, the data for the lookup can be provided in three different ways:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>As data literal in the upload API.</li>
            
                <li>As a URL callback, where your data is a URL like https://www.my.data.</li>
            
                <li>As an Authenticated Resource Locator (ARL) (the preferred method)</li>
            </ul>

           <p>The maximum size of a lookup is 15MB through the REST API and 512KB through the web interface.</p>
            
            <h3>Optimized Format</h3>
            
            <p>Sometimes when creating a Lookup you may want to include the right metadata for each element of the lookup, but the maximum size may be an issue. In cases where there is a lot of metadata repetition you may use an optimized format. This format will allow you to associate large pieces of metadata with a high number of lookup items.</p>
            
            <p>To accomplish this, you will need to split up your metadata from your lookup values like:</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/e442551ad0d25a3433a836c331c3e581.js"></script>

            <p>The <code>_LC_METADATA</code> key has as a value a list of all the pieces of metadata you want to include.</p>

            <p>The <code>_LC_INDICATORS</code>> is the normal list of indicators, but instead of having the metadata directly associated with each indicator as the value, it uses an integer that refers to the <code>_LC_METADATA</code> list's index where the metadata can be found.</p>

            <p>The above example is equivalent to the non-optimized:</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/cc080fbcc72096f31509dcf937755710.js"></script>

            <p>As you can see, this optimization is useful to reduce the repeated metadata. This is particularly useful if, for example, you have large numbers of IoCs for a given actor. In that case every IoC in the lookup would be associated with the same metadata (information about the actor).</p>

            <h3>From MISP</h3>
            
            <p>When creating an add-on from MISP content, LimaCharlie expects the data to be a JSON document to have the following structure:</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/651ff77bb5638087666400d657316341.js"></script>

            <p>The MISP event above once ingested in LC will be transformed to a Lookup like:</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/b4ba1696780a3f003051fdb0d4fc0112.js"></script>

            <p>LimaCharlie understands the MISP format regardless of how it is ingested. That being said, the classic way of ingesting it would be to ingest the MSIP Events use an ARL on a MISP REST API with one of the supported ARL authentication types like basic.</p>

            <p>For example:</p> <code>[https,misp.my.corp.com/events/1234,basic,myuser:mypassword]</code>.

            <h3>Reference D&R Rules</h3>

            <p>To put a Lookup "into effect", you need a D&R rule. The Lookup is a list of elements while the rule describes what you want to look</p> for in that list.

            <p>Below is a list of D&R rules describing how to lookup various common Indicators of Compromise:</p>

            <h3>Hashes</h3>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/4050dd559142c2f962c1575969f90020.js"></script>

            <h3>Domain Names</h3>

            <h3>IP Address</h3>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/50a13e0167e9dcede9355a8327e17113.js"></script>

            <h2>VirusTotal</h2>

            <p>The lookup can also use certain APIs in their lookup, such as VirusTotal. Note that for the VT API to be accessible, the organization needs to be subscribed to the VT API Add-On, and a valid VT API Key needs to be set in the integrations configurations.</p>

            <p>As shown in the example below, a metadata_rules parameter is also valid for the lookup operation. It can contain further detection rules to be applied to the metadata returned by a lookup match. In the case of VT this is a dictionary of AntiVirus vendor reports (here we test for more than 1 vendor reporting that the hash is bad), while in the case of a custom lookup resource it would be whatever is set as the item's metadata.</p>

            <p>To activate VirusTotal usage, you must subscibe to the VirusTotal API in the Add-On section. Then you must set your VirusTotal API key in the Integrations section of the limacharlie.io web interface.</p>

            <p>VirusTotal results are cached locally for a limited period of time which reduces the usage of your API key and saves you money.</p>

           <p> Also note that if your API Key runs out of quota with VirusTotal, hashes seen until you have quota again will be ignored.</p>

            <p>Example:</p>
