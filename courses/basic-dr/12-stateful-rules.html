            <p>Generally the D&R rules operate in a stateless fashion, meaning a rule operates on one event at a time and either matches or does not.</p>

            <p>To be able to perform D&R rules across events to detect more complex behaviors, you can use the <code>with child</code> and <code>with descendant</code> parameters. Note that those parameters can ONLY be specified on a rule operator specifying the <code>event: NEW_PROCESS</code> since they only apply to the relationship between an event and a process.</p>

            <p>Both the <code>with child</code> and <code>with descendant</code> parameters are effectively the same except for the "depth" of the relationship they cover. The <code>child</code> specifies that the target state (described below) must apply to the direct children of the matching process. The <code>descendant</code> specifies that the target state must apply globally to any descendants (children of children) of the matching process.</p>

            <p>The value of a <code>with child</code> (or descendant) is simply another (stateless) rule operator. The logic defined in this rule operator describes the set of conditions that must match, not a single event, but the collection of events that are children (or descendants) of the matching process.</p>

            <p>Here is an example of a stateful detection looking for a <code>cmd.exe</code> process that has a child <code>calc.exe</code>:</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/f6ea45687c0a43d62cd387a3d647e247.js"></script>

            <p>Simply put, this will detect</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/8089b31834d0b2a8645311130dc72208.js"></script>

            <p>but not</p>
            
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/1ac7d41064cd6e31859e6678cc4940fd.js"></script>

            <p>If we made the <code>with child</code> a <code>with descendant</code>, then we could detect:</p>
            
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/3b2f2401fbd82fb8f8fd1ae7b09069b3.js"></script>

            <p>Much like other stateless rules, the <code>with child</code> (and descendant) can also be more complex. For example:</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/8ec2edfd4c9a43a12ef200c5011f3c56.js"></script>

            <p>The above example is looking for an <code>outlook.exe</code> process that spawns a <code>chrome.exe</code> and drops a <code>.ps1</code> (powershell) file to disk:</p>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/c56896d615e69f5e7f92cd194c457715.js"></script>

            <p>On top of containing stateless rules, an operator underneath a <code>with child</code> (or descendant) can also contain another operator with another <code>with child</code> (or descendant).</p>

            <p>Another parameter comes into play if you want to define a set of operators underneath a <code>with child</code> to be "stateless", meaning where you want all the operators to apply and match with single events (like the classic stateless D&R rules). This parameter is <code>is stateless: true</code>. Simply add it to the operators at the root of the logic you want to be applied statelessly.</p>

            <p>Finally, a node in stateful mode under a <code>with child</code> or <code>with descendant</code> can specify a <code>count: N</code> parameter. When specified, you specify that the given node must be matched N times before it is considered successful. So setting <code>count: 3</code> in a node looking for a <code>event/FILE_PATH</code> ending in <code>cmd.exe</code> will mean that we want to match only if we see 3 instances of a <code>cmd.exe</code> in that context to match. An example usage of this is to set <code>count:</code> in a <code>matches</code> operator looking for a set of processes which would result in detecting a "burst" of matching processes from a parent (like: if a process starts more than 3 <code>cmd.exe</code>, alert). Adding a <code>within: Z</code> parameter to the <code>count: N</code> limits the count to where the first and last event in the count is within a <code>Z</code> seconds time window.</p>
