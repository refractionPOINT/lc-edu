            <p>Once installed the LimaCharlie <a href="https://doc.limacharlie.io/docs/documentation/docs/lc-agent.md" target="_blank">Agent</a> is able to track over 70 <a href="https://doc.limacharlie.io/docs/documentation/docs/events.md" target="_blank">Event</a> types as they take place on the endpoint. These events produce telemetry which is shared with the LimaCharlie Cloud in real-time. The telemetry is evaluated against a collection of Detection & Response (DR) rules in the LimaCharlie Cloud. DR rules are generally applied on a per-event basis. When the rule is applied the detection component of the rule is processed to determine if it matches. If it matches the response component is actioned. Response actions can include tasking the sensor, isolating the host from the network, sending an alert, along with many other possibilities.</p>
