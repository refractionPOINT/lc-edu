            <p>The algorithm also has a short circuit feature so that once the minimum conditions for success or failure are satisfied for a detection it stops computing and exits.</p>

            <p>Adept rule authors will front-load the evaluation sequence with the least computationally intense components. This strategy will ensure that events are processed as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p>The evaluation would be satisfied and exit in the following example if op2 was the first to return true in the Eularian order of evaluations.</p>
