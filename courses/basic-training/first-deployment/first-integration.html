	<p dir="ltr">LimaCharlie also offers an integration with VirusTotal. If you do not already have an account with VirusTotal you will have to create one and get an API key.</p>

	<p dir="ltr">Once you have created an account find the API key.&nbsp;</p>

	<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/thinkific/file_uploads/228508/images/e2a/209/ee9/virus-total.png" style="width: 730px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-bordered"></p>

	<p dir="ltr">The free tier of VirusTotal allows four lookups per minute via the API.</p>

	<p dir="ltr">Note:&nbsp;LimaCharlie employs a global cache of all VirusTotal requests which should significantly reduce your costs if you are using VirusTotal at scale.</p>

	<p dir="ltr">Once you have your VirusTotal API key you can go to the integrations section of the LimaCharlie web app and add your key.</p>

	<p dir="ltr">Once you have entered your API key you can then create a DR rule to let you know if you get a hit from VirusTotal on a file with more than two different engines saying it is bad.</p>

	<p dir="ltr" style="margin-left: 60px;"><code>path: event/HASH<br>op: lookup<br>resource: &#39;lcr://api/vt&#39;<br>event: CODE_IDENTITY<br>metadata_rules:<br>&nbsp; path: /<br>&nbsp; value: 2<br>&nbsp; length of: true<br>&nbsp; op: is greater than<br></code></p>

	<p dir="ltr">Once again the response component of this rule is left up to the user an exercise.</p>
