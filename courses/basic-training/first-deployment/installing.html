			<p>To get started you will need to create an installation key. Installation keys can be created by visiting the <em>Installation Keys</em> section of the web application and clicking on the plus icon in the upper right corner.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/thinkific/file_uploads/228508/images/e0d/606/9e8/installation-key.png"></p>

			<p>Once the key has been created copy it to your clipboard. Next visit the Sensor Downloads section of the web application and download the appropriate installer.</p>

			<p>Once the sensor is downloaded to the endpoint you will need to give it the appropriate permissions and use the installation key when executing.</p>

			<p>Installing the sensor requires administrator (or root) execution:</p>

			<p><strong>Windows:</strong> installer.exe -i YOUR_INSTALLATION_KEY</p>

		</br>

			<img style="float:left; max-width: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/thinkific/file_uploads/228508/images/f31/99d/c4d/apple.png"/>
			<p><strong>MacOS:</strong> chmod +x installer ; installer -i YOUR_INSTALLATION_KEY</p>

		</br>

			<img style="float:left; max-width: 20px;" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/thinkific/file_uploads/228508/images/7d7/c3a/130/linux.png"/>
			<p><strong>Linux:</strong> chmod +x installer ; installer -d YOUR_INSTALLATION_KEY</p>

		</br>

			<p><strong>Note:</strong> On Linux the exact persistence mechanism, like launchd, is left to the administrator, therefore the -d argument launches the sensor from the current working directory without persistence. The sensor does not daemonize itself.</p>

			<p>If you wish to remove the sensor from the endpoint you can do so by running the installer with the <code>-c</code> flag.</p>

			<p>Once the sensor is installed it should show up in the Sensors section of the web application.</p>

			<p>LimaCharlie is Security Infrastructure as a Service (SIaaS). You can think of LimaCharlie as the Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) of information security. Our EDR capability can be thought of as the equivalent of EC2.</p>

			<p>To enjoy the full capabilities of LimaCharlie you will need to enable the long term storage feature called Insight (the S3 to our EC2). With this feature enabled the LimaCharlie platform will store all telemetry data produced by the agents for one year. With the telemetry storage feature enabled you will be able to search for IOCs across your whole organization and utilize all of the tools available. LimaCharlie offers External Log Storage which is also indexed across IOCs and allows users to execute these same capabilities across log files</p>

			<p>You can enable Insight be visiting the Add Ons section and clicking the toggle.</p>
