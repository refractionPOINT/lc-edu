			<p>The LimaCharlie technology stack starts with a highly capable software agent that runs on the host.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><img class="img-float-right" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/thinkific/file_uploads/228508/images/183/5c5/918/no-hooking.png" style="width: 360px;" class="fr-fic fr-fir fr-dii"></p>

			<p>Once installed on the endpoint the agent maintains a persistent TLS connection to the cloud where events are monitored and evaluated. On the host the agent acts as a good citizen of the operating system and will not get picked up by antivirus software (it does not hook into the kernel and abides by all APIs).</p>

			<p>The LimaCharlie agent has zero impact on endpoint performance, even when analyzing, searching and investigating incidents. The agent deploys in seconds with no reboot required. Round-trip times from when a detection is triggered on the endpoint to when a response action takes place is generally under 100ms.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>The total footprint of the agent on disk combined with what is in memory is approximately 2MB. The agent typically runs under 1% CPU with small spikes around certain events and usually uses less than 50MB of RAM.</p>

			<p>The amount of data that is produced by the agent is dependent on the activity that is taking place on the endpoint. That being said, the average data produced per endpoint across thousands of deployments is approximately 1MB per day.</p>

			<p>The number of sensors that can be concurrently connected (not total sensors registered, just concurrently connected) is determined by a user defined quota that is reflected in billing.</p>

Custom builds of the agent for OpenBSD and Solaris can be made upon request.</p>

			<p>There is also an agent for Chrome and Chrome OS which encompasses a subset of the functionality. This agent can be run on Chromebooks or as a stand-alone in the browser. When used in parallel with the primary agent visibility into URL requests is obtained. The Chrome agent is included in the base fee for the primary agent.</p>

			<p>
				<br>You can download the Chrome agent from the Chrome store.</p>
