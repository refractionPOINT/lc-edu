            SDK
The root of the functionality in the SDK is from the Manager object. It holds the crendentials and is tied to a specific Organization.

You can authenticate the Manager using an oid (and optionally a uid), along with either a secret_api_key or jwt directly. Alternatively you can just use an environment name (as specified in limacharlie login). If no creds are provided, the Manager will try to use the default environment and credentials.
