            <p>In this video series, Maxime Lamothe-Brassard talks about leveraging open source resources to get up and running with threat coverage quickly using LimaCharlie. He walks through how to use Alien Vault’s Open Threat Exchange (OTX), Virus Total’s free tier API, curated collections of Sigma and YARA rules,  and how to consume any threat feed of IP addresses or hashes. As well as talking about LimaCharlie’s curated Marketplace where people generating specialized intelligence can potentially sell access to their information.</p>
