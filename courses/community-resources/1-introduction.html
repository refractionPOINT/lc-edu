            In this video series, Maxime Lamothe-Brassard talks about leveraging open source resources to get up and running with threat coverage quickly using LimaCharlie. He walks through how to use Alien Vault’s Open Threat Exchange (OTX), Virus Total’s free tier API, curated collections of Sigma and YARA rules,  and how to consume any threat feed of IP addresses or hashes. As well as talking about LimaCharlie’s curated Marketplace where people generating specialized intelligence can potentially sell access to their information.

            Sigma is a generic and open signature format that allows you to describe relevant log events in a straightforward manner. The rule format is very flexible, easy to write and applicable to any type of log file. The main purpose of this project is to provide a structured form in which researchers or analysts can describe their once developed detection methods and make them shareable with others.
            
            Sigma is for log files what Snort is for network traffic and YARA is for files.
