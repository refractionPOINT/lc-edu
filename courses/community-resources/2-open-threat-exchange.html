            <h3>Open Threat Exchange</h3>
        
            <p>Open Threat Exchange is the neighborhood watch of the global intelligence community. It enables private companies, independent security researchers, and government agencies to openly collaborate and share the latest information about emerging threats, attack methods, and malicious actors, promoting greater security across the entire community.</p>

            <p>OTX changed the way the intelligence community creates and consumes threat data. In OTX, anyone in the security community can contribute, discuss, research, validate, and share threat data. You can integrate community-generated OTX threat data directly into your AlienVault and third-party security products, so that your threat detection defenses are always up to date with the latest threat intelligence. Today, 100,000 participants in 140 countries contribute over 19 million threat indicators daily.</p>

            More information can be found on the <a href="https://otx.alienvault.com/" target="_blank">OTX website here</a>.
