            <h3>Sigma</h3>

            Sigma is a generic and open signature format that allows you to describe relevant log events in a straightforward manner. The rule format is very flexible, easy to write and applicable to any type of log file. The main purpose of this project is to provide a structured form in which researchers or analysts can describe their once developed detection methods and make them shareable with others.

            More information can be found on the official <a href="https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma" target="">Github repository here</a>.
