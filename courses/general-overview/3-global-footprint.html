Choosing a geographical location ensures data will always be processed in this location and never moved outside. New data centres can be spun up <a href="https://cloud.google.com/about/locations" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">anywhere GCP is available</a> upon customer request.</p>

			<p>LimaCharlie employs a multi-tenant architecture. Every cluster is built across multiple zones to maintain high-availability. Clusters are available in multiple regions to deal with any legal requirements and all access to these clusters is transparent. The LimaCharlie Cloud is deployed using Kubernetes and can be horizontally scaled to any size to meet demand dynamically.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Connectivity between agents and the clusters is done point-to-point and is secured using pinned SSL certificates. This enables easy deployments and the seamless transition of assets between offices and networks.</p>

			<p>Each cluster has its own transport keys and each organization has its own command keys. All keys are encrypted in storage and runtime access to the envelope keys is limited to server containers. All sensitive output configurations are encrypted per organization.</p>
