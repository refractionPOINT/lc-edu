			<h2>Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)</h2>

			<p>The first core technology available in LimaCharlie was the EDR.</p>

			<p>The EDR provides a whole suite of powerful capabilities and is built off of a lightweight, cross-platform agent.</p>
			
			<p>The LimaCharlie endpoint agent has the best cross-platform support in the industry and can be used to bring the most diverse fleets into a single detection stream. The agent runs on 32-bit Windows all way Back to Windows XP SP II through to the most modern version of 64-bit Windows. It can run on all flavours of Linux both 32-bit and 64-bit. Builds for MacOS (Intel & M1) are also available. Builds for Solaris and BSD that can be produced on request. The lightweight footprint of LimaCharlieâ€™s agent makes it well suited for IoT and builds across x86, ARM and MIPS architectures are available for all platforms.</p>
			
			<p>The agent is written in C and then compiled for each different platform and architecture it runs on which means that it has true feature parity across all operating systems. The only exceptions are platform specific functions, such as monitoring Windows registry operations, etc.</p>
			
			<p>When the agent is installed and running it is referred to as a sensor in agent is approximately 500kb in size but that varies a little depending on which platform it is compiled for. While running it consumes less that 1% CPU but does spike very briefly when certain events take place like an application starting up. LimaCharlie is able to pack so much power into such a small program because it treats the agent as an extension of the cloud by utilizing a true real-time persistent TLS connection. The round trip time from an event being detected to the time a response is actioned on the endpoint is generally less than 100 milliseconds.</p>
			
			<p>LimaCharlie also offers the industry's only Chrome OS agent. The agent can be used as a standalone on machines running Chrome OS or as a sidecar agent in the browser where it can do HTTP inspection removing the need for SSL interception.</p>
			
			<p>Telemetry is produced for evaluation by the Detection & Response Engine via the sensor that monitors Events taking place on the endpoint. The LimaCharlie sensor monitors over 75 Events taking place on the endpoint. A full list of Events can be found here.</p>
			
			<p>Complete endpoint telemetry is stored in a one year rolling window. All telemetry is indexed and searchable across common indicators of compromise.</p>

			<p>Detection rules are written against telemetry and when a positive match occurs a Response action is initiated.</p>
			
			<p>Response actions can take many forms and are often used for automating between different parts of the LimaCharlie platform.</p>

			<ul>

			<p>The Detection & Response Engine behind the EDR capability plays a central role in coordinating between the different core technologies and lays the foundation for automating operations at scale.</p>

			<h2>Comms</h2>



			<p dir="ltr">Details on each of these capabilities and functionality can be found below.</p>



			<h3 dir="ltr">Live View</h3>

			<p dir="ltr">Live View allows the user to interact with the endpoint in real-time. Users interact with the endpoints as if they were an extension of the cloud and with Live View users can:</p>

			<ul>
				<li dir="ltr">Adjust the telemetry for a given endpoint.</li>
				<li dir="ltr">Send console commands.</li>
				<li dir="ltr">Stream a feed of events taking place on the endpoint in real-time.</li>
				<li dir="ltr">List the running processes.</li>
				<li dir="ltr">View modules.</li>
				<li dir="ltr">Get memory strings.</li>
				<li dir="ltr">Get memory maps.</li>
				<li dir="ltr">Pull system information, kill suspend and resume processes.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 dir="ltr">Payloads &amp; File Retrieval</h3>

			<p dir="ltr">The agent maintains a semi-persistent, real-time connection to the LimaCharlie Cloud which allows the user to retrieve files of any size from the endpoint. Data is streamed in approximately 10MB chunks and sent to a bucket in the LimaCharlie Cloud for reassembly.</p>

			<p dir="ltr">Conversely, and under very specific permissions, users can send an executable down to the host for execution.These payloads can be any executable. The main use case is to run something with specific functionality not available directly from LimaCharlie. For example: custom executables provided by another vendor to cleanup a machine, forensic utilities or firmware-related utilities.</p>

			<p dir="ltr">The payloads feature is powerful and should be treated as such. Users are encouraged to look at LimaCharlie&rsquo;s native functionality first as it has several advantages:</p>

			<ul>
				<li dir="ltr">Better performance.</li>
				<li dir="ltr">Data returned is well structured JSON.</li>
				<li dir="ltr">Can be tasked automatically</li>
				<li dir="ltr"><a href="https://doc.limacharlie.io/en/master/dr/">Detection &amp; Response</a> rules can be created from their data.</li>
				<li dir="ltr">Data returned is indexed and searchable.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 dir="ltr">Data Forwarding</h3>

			<p dir="ltr">All telemetry produced by the LimaCharlie agent can be forwarded to any location. Most common technologies are supported such as Syslog, SFTP, AWS S3, Google Storage, SMTP and more. Users can set up complex forwarding rules for different types of telemetry and alerts.</p>

			<p dir="ltr"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/thinkific/file_uploads/228508/images/0ae/2f6/3fe/outputs.png" style="width: 646px;" class="fr-fic fr-dib"></p>

			<p dir="ltr">Forwarding is done in real-time or near real-time depending on forwarding methodology.
				<br>If storage is not enabled then the telelemtry being forwarded is done so on the wire and never written to disk as it transits through the LimaCharlie infrastructure.</p>

			<h3 dir="ltr">Artifact Collection</h3>

			<p>LimaCharlie can ingest any files from the endpoint as well as files pushed through the API/CLI/SDK.
				<br>
				<br>Log files can be uploaded on an ongoing basis and have detection logic applied to them as they are being processed. Detection logic can also be applied to historical logs across the entire fleet.LimaCharlie can consume logs from any OS. Logs can be unstructured (no parsers necessary), pcap or Windows logs. Another typical use case sees users downloadportable executables and pre-fetch files which can also have detection logic applied to them.</p>

			<p dir="ltr">Information on log ingestion can be found in the documentation<a href="http://doc.limacharlie.io/en/master/external_logs/">here</a>, and information on log specific DR rules can be <a href="https://doc.limacharlie.io/en/master/dr/#targets">found here.</a></p>

			<h3 dir="ltr">Search &amp; Historical Threat Hunting</h3>

			<p dir="ltr">All telemetry, logs, portable executables and pre-fetch files that are ingested by LimaCharlie are indexed across common indicators of compromise. Along with this, all events are marked with a special set of IDs, referred to as atoms, that can be used to traverse process trees.</p>

			<p dir="ltr">Searching is powered by BigQuery and this enables users to search up to a year&rsquo;s worth of telemetry across entire fleets with results available in moments.</p>

			<p dir="ltr">LimaCharlie also uses the concept of targets with D&amp;R rules which means that users can create detection logic that can be applied to log files as they are ingested or over historical log data.</p>

			<h3 dir="ltr">Integrations</h3>

			<p dir="ltr">LimaCharlie exposes a full-featured and <a href="https://api.limacharlie.io/static/swagger/#/LimaCharlie_Cloud">well-documented REST API</a> along with providing a Python CLI and SDK.</p>

			<p dir="ltr">LimaCharlie enables automation and integration with other systems and feeds. An HTTPS-based data stream - referred to as PULL mode - can be used to create real-time integrations.</p>

			<p dir="ltr">Along with an Integration framework, LimaCharlie offers two pre-built integrations.</p>

			<h4 dir="ltr">VirusTotal</h4>

			<p dir="ltr">Use LimaCharlie with <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/">Virus Total</a>. Bring your own key and have hashes from your endpoints checked on VT automatically. Make it part of your Detection &amp; Response rules to automate response in real-time. Pool your queries and save money.</p>

			<h4 dir="ltr">Humio</h4>

			<p dir="ltr">Use LimaCharlie with <a href="https://humio.com/">Humio</a> to store telemetry data. Humio is a solution built specifically for aggregating, exploring, reporting and analyzing data in real-time. It gathers log data from a range of sources and can be deployed in both cloud and on-premise environments.</p>

			<h4 dir="ltr">Backstory</h4>

			<p dir="ltr">LimaCharlie has partnered with Chronicle Security to deliver an integration with their Backstory security analytics platform.</p>

			<p dir="ltr">The LimaCharlie agent contributes valuable endpoint telemetry and capability to Backstory&rsquo;s enterprise security offering. The integration with Backstory will allow for the global correlation between log and endpoint telemetry providing a unique global perspective and access to threat intelligence not found anywhere else.</p>

			<h3 dir="ltr">Community Resources</h3>

			<p dir="ltr">Leveraging the integration and extension friendly nature of the platform, LimaCharlie has built-in support for several Community Resources.</p>

			<h4 dir="ltr">YARA</h4>

			<p dir="ltr">LimaCharlie can now use YARA rules to scan external files as they are ingested. This new feature comes on the heels of our historical threat hunting service (Replay) which allows users to search up to a year&rsquo;s worth of telemetry data across a fleet using Detection &amp; Response rules. We believe that these two features combined make for a powerful set of detection tools. The possibilities for new forensic and defensive capabilities are near limitless.</p>

			<p dir="ltr">Details on how this new YARA feature fits within the content of the existing Detection &amp; Response framework can be found here:<a href="https://doc.limacharlie.io/en/master/dr/#yara">https://doc.limacharlie.io/en/master/dr/#yara</a></p>

			<h4 dir="ltr">Sigma</h4>

			<p>The Sigma rule set is an open source signature format that can describe relevant log events in a straightforward manner. The rule format itself is very flexible and applicable to any type of log file. The main purpose of Sigma is to provide a structured form with which researchers and analysts can describe and share detections methods with the wider community.</p>

			<h4 dir="ltr">Zeek</h4>

			<p dir="ltr">LimaCharlie users can now register for the Zeek Service. With this service enabled any PCAP files uploaded to LimaCharlie (either automatically through an agent, the API or through the CLI) is automatically processed and &ldquo;exploded&rdquo; using Zeek.</p>

			<p dir="ltr">The Zeek log format gets normalized to JSON, which in turn allows D&amp;R rules to be applied to those logs.</p>

			<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.limacharlie.io/blog/2020/2/6/introducing-zeek-network-monitoring">https://www.limacharlie.io/blog/2020/2/6/introducing-zeek-network-monitoring</a></p>

			<h4 dir="ltr">MISP &amp; OTX Pulse Formats</h4>

			<p dir="ltr">LimaCharlie supports the MISP JSON format. If you create a Lookup pointing to MISP JSON, the format will be parsed and the lookup will associate the MISP IDs as the Attribute metadata. LimaCharlie similarly supports the JSON OTX Pulse format from AlienVault.</p>

			<h3 dir="ltr">Public &amp; Private Extensions</h3>

			<h4 dir="ltr">Authenticated Sources</h4>

			<p dir="ltr">Many of the services we provide facilitate outside resources. Today we are happy to announce support for the consumption of external resources that require authentication. YARA rules, threat feeds and other external resources can now be fetched from private Github repos and other protected sources.</p>

			<h4 dir="ltr">Live Sweep</h4>

			<p>A Live Sweep is an in-depth look through the state of a host. The sweep will highlight parts of the activity that are suspicious. This provides you with a good starting position when beginning an investigation. It allows you to focus on the important things right away.

				<p>The types of information returned by the sweep is constantly evolving but you can expect it to return the following information:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>A full list of processes and modules</li>
					
					<li>A list of unsigned binary code running in processes</li>
					
					<li>Network connections with a list of processes listening and active on the network</li>
					
					<li>Hidden modules</li>
					
					<li>A list of recently modified files</li>
					
					<li>Unique or rare indicators of compromise</li>
				</ul>
