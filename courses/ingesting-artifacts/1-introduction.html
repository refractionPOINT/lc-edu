            <p>In this course, Maxime Lamothe-Brassard talks about LimaCharlie’s powerful ability to ingest almost any external artifact - such as Windows Event Logs, Log files, PCAPS, pfSense (pf firewall logs in syslog format, logs from pfBlocker, etc.) and many more! All ingested artifacts are indexed along common indicators of compromise (IoC’s) and run through the LimaCharlie Detection & Response (DR) engine. DR rules can be run against artifacts as they are ingested or over historical data.</p>
