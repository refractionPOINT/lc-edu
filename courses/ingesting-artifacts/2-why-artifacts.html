            <h2>Artifact Collection</h2>
            
            <p>The Artifact Collection system allows you to ingest artifact types like:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Plain text logs (syslog for example)</li>
                <li>Windows Event Logs</li>
                <li>PCAPs</li>
                <li>Windows Prefetch files</li>
                <li>Windows PE (executables) files</li>
                <li>Zeek (previously Bro)</li>
                <li>Full memory dumps</li>
                <li>Generic JSON</li>
                <li>OLE (MS Word, Excel etc)</li>
                <li>Windows MFT CSV Listing</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Those artifacts can be ingested from hosts running a LimaCharlie sensor, or they can be pushed to the LimaCharlie platform via the CLI or REST interface.</p>
            
            <p>Once ingested, the artifacts are retained and made available to you with a custom retention period. Ingested artifacts are also indexed similarly to LimaCharlie events. This means that you can search all of your artifact for the last year for Indicators like IP Addresses, Domain Names, User Names, Hashes etc.</p>
            
            <p>This in turn makes it possible for you to be looking at sensor data, identity an IP of interest, and launch a quick search to see if this IP has been observed in any artifacts over the past year. If it has, with one click you can visualize the relevant artifact entries to assist you in your investigation.</p>
            
            <p>We call this "artifact operationalization". It is not mean to be a general viewing and querying tool like Splunk, but as a tactical tool providing you with critical answers as you need them during security operations.</p>
            
            <p>Note that Artifact Collection configurations are synchronized with sensors every few minutes.</p>
