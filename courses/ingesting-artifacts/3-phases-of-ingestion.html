            <p>Artifact ingestion and processing involves several steps outlined as follows.</p>

            <h3>Ingestion</h3>

            <p>Artifacts are injested into LimaCharlie via the REST API, automatically from the sensor or through the CLI tool.</p>

            <h3>Normalize to JSON</h3>

            <p>A copy of the original document is saved and then the file is normailzed into JSON. These normalized JSON files are further indexed across common indicators of compromise.</p>

            <h3>Detection & Response Engine</h3>

            <p>The normalized JSON file (the Artifact) and the injestion Event are then run through the LimaCharlie Detection & Response engine where indicators of compromise are checked against detection logic at wire speed.</p>

            <h3>Custom Retention</h3>

            <p>The original Artifact and mirror JSON file are then stored for a custom retention period defined by the user.</p>
