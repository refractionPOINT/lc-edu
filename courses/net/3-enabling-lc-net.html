            <p>LimaCharlie Net endpoints appear like other endpoints in your LimaCharlie deployment, but they're quite different in nature. These lc-net endpoints need to be provisioned to be accessed.</p>

            <p>By provisioning an lc-net endpoint, you create a set of VPN credentials that can be used by a single device. One set of credentials should be used by only a single device, they should not be shared among devices.</p>
            
            <p>Once connected, these devices will be able to connect to the internet by default. Connectivity and additional features that can be enabled by lc-net are defined using "policies".</p>
            
            <p>Clients connected can access the internet, but they can also access each other based on the policies you define. This makes lc-net great to secure internal network services for access from specific devices, on premises, on the road, or from home.</p>
            
            <p>The underlying technology used for VPN is called <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/" target="_blank">WireGuard</a>. WireGuard is a next-generation VPN technology that is promoted for its simplicity, speed, and security.<p>
            
            <p>Clients are available for <a href="https://www.wireguard.com/install/" target="_blank">Windows, Android, macOS, Linux, iOS and ChromeOS</a>. Client configuration is done either through a QR code or a simple configuration file.</p>
