            <h2>lc-net-install Service</h2>

            <p>This LimaCharlie Service called lc-net-install currently only supports Windows. It allows you to easily provision and upgrade an lc-agent to lc-net.</p>
            
            <p>Since it is a LimaCharlie Service it means you can either directly interact with the service or you can issue service requests via the API and even D&R rules.</p>
            
            <p>To use the service, you will need:</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>The Net version of the Installation Key you want your new lc-net sensors to use: go to the Installation Key section, if you don't have a key create one, and then click the copy-to-clipboard button for the Net key.</li>
            
                <li>The Sensor ID (sid) of the sensor you wish to upgrade. If you are using the Service interactively through the web interface, you may use the Hostname of the sensor and the web interface will auto-complete the Sensor ID.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>These steps assume you are using the web interface, but the same basic steps and parameters apply to other methods.</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Go in the main page of the Organization where you want to upgrade sensors to lc-net.</li>
                
                <li>From the left menu, go to the Add-ons section, Services tab, lc-net-install service and set to "on".</li>
                
                <li>From the left menu, go to the Service Request section.</li>
                
                <li>Select the lc-net-install service from the "Service" drop down.</li>
                
                <li>In the "iid" section, enter the Net Installation Key (obtained earlier).</li>
                
                <li>In the "sid" section, select the Sensor ID by hostname or just enter the Sensor ID itself.</li>
                
                <li>Click "Request". The service will create a new Job that will be visible from the Organization's main page where you can track the progress of the upgrade. The whole process should take less than a minute.</li>
            </ol>
