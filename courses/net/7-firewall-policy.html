            <h3>Firewall</h3>

            <p>Firewall policies define what outbound access is allowed or disallowed. Since all clients in lc-net are under a NAT, the inbound access is defined through <code>service</code> policies (details further below).</p>

            <p>By default when you create a new organization and enable lc-net, a firewall policy will be created for you, as specified below.</p>

            <p>This default policy gives access by all the clients to the internet without any limitation. This policy is required by default to provide connectivity because lc-net denies all outbound connections by default (safe by default). This means that if you remove this policy, all outbound access will be disabled.</p>

            <p>Firewall policies can either specify:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><code>is_allow: true</code> indicating this policy defines a destination that should be allowed</li>

                <li><code>is_allow: false</code> indicating this policy defines a destination that should be denied</li>
            </ul>

            <p>On a connection, all <code>firewall</code> policies will be applied. For the connection to be allowed, at least one policy must positively allow the traffic. If, however even a single policy defines the destination is not allowed, then the connection will be denied.</p>

            <p>Sample policy:</p>
