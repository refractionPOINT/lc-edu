            <h3>Service</h3>

            <p>Service policies define a service available through the network on a specific host, and which other endpoints have access to it.</p>

            <p>The <code>server_sid</code> specifies the Sensor ID of the lc-net endpoint running the service. The <code>service_port</code> defines a specific port (or<code> 0</code> for any) where the service is running.<p>

            <p>The <code>tag_clients</code> specifies a tag that defines which lc-net endpoints have access to this service.</p>

            <p>The <code>protocol</code> defines the network protocol ID that the service is allowed on. TCP is <code>6</code> and UDP is <code>17</code>.</p>

            <p>The following example describes that all lc-net endpoints with the <code>finance</code> tag should be allowed to connect to the service running on TCP port 8000 for the Sensor ID <code>9ccd5a2c-e83c-4ffb-8f52-9f48626a6fc6</code>.</p>

            <p>Once in place, accessing this service can be done using the server's Internal IP that is available through the detailed information view of a given sensor. In the case of lc-net endpoints, this Internal IP is always in the <code>10.x.x.x</code> range and is static, meaning a sensor is given an Internal IP that it will keep for its whole lifetime, making it easier to bookmark services or even create your own DNS entries for services.</p>

            <p>Sample policy:</p>
