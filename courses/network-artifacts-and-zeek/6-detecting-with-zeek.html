            <h3>Alerting on Zeek Logs</h3>
            
            <p>Now that the Zeek logs are ingested as Artifacts, it means we can write rules over them.</p>

            <p>When we do this, it's important to understand how the Zeek logs will be interpreted for the D&R rules. All Artifacts see the D&R rules engine evaluate them one "record" at a time. A "record" will depend on the exact Artifact type. For PCAPs, a record is a single packet, for Syslog, a record is a log line. For Zeek a record is also a log line.</p>

            <p>Zeek logs are interpreted as first-class formats in LimaCharlie. This means that they're not simply treated as text (although the original text logs are always kept and available). The Zeek logs get parsed and converted to JSON automatically. This well-parsed format is what allows you to make D&R rules that are precise and don't rely on messy regular expressions.</p>

            <p>To see what the D&R rules will process exactly, go to the Artifact Collection section of the web app, find a Zeek log entry at the bottom and click on the little "window expand" green icon for that log. This will open in a new tab the contents of the Zeek log, as parsed by LimaCharlie. You'll see it's a list of JSON records. This means that when we build our D&R rule, we want to describe how to match a JSON record.</p>

            <p>Let's make our D&R rule:</p>

            <strong>Detection:</strong>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/4e6380436bd214e6a12d874e8b4ae28f.js"></script>
            
            <strong>Response:</strong>

            <script src="https://gist.github.com/tekgrunt/2c010dcd37362ca432f20abf0b142246.js"></script>
            
            <p>This rule is quite simple:</p>

            <p>Detect any record from a zeek type artifact that has a id.orig_p key with a value of "23". This is a field from a Zeek log's conn.log file that contains the originating port of a connection.</p>

            <p>The Response simply states to report (alert) with a name of outbound connection from telnet port.</p>

            <strong>Conclusion</strong>

            <p>That's it, from this point on, we'll alert on automatically collect network data, retain it, process it with Zeek, retain those Zeek logs and alert on those logs as well.</p>
