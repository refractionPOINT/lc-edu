            <p>The goal of this portion of the course is to create a DR rule to detect the MITRE ATT&CK framework for <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1196/" target="_blank">Control Panel Items</a> execution, as well as validate, test and publish the rule.</p> 

            <h3>Setup and Requirements</h3>

            <p>To complete this section of the course you will need access to a Linux host (or MacOS terminal with <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">brew</a> installed). Along with this you will also need owner access to an organization on LimaCharlie. If you do not have an organization already you can create one - this code lab is completely compatiable with the free teir provided to all LimaCharlie users.</p>

            <h3>Services Used</h3>

            <p>This code lab will use the Detection & Response service as well as the Replay service to validate and the rule prior to pushing it to production</p>
