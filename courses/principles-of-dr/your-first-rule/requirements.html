            <p>The goal of this portion of the course is to create a DR rule to detect the MITRE ATT&CK framework for <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1196/" target="_blank">Control Panel Items</a> execution, as well as validate, test and publish the rule.</p> 

            <h3>Setup and Requirements</h3>

            <p>To complete this section of the course you will need access to a Linux host (or MacOS terminal with <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">brew</a> installed). Along with this you will also need owner access to an organization on LimaCharlie. If you do not have an organization already you can create one - this code lab is completely compatible with the free tier provided to all LimaCharlie users.</p>

            <h3>Services Used</h3>

            <p>This code lab will use the Detection & Response service as well as the Replay service to validate the rule prior to pushing it to production.  Ensure the Replay service is turned on in your LimaCharlie organization by going to the Add-Ons -> Services section in the web app and checking the toggle next to "replay".</p>
