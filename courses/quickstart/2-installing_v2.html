			<h2>Installing the Agent</h2>

			<p>Before we can start leveraging the capabilities available in LimaCharlie we have to get up and running first. This section takes the user through getting set up with an agent running on an endpoint.</p>

			If you have not already, creat an account and your first Organization.
			
			<div class="wrap-collabsible">
				<input id="collapsible" class="toggle" type="checkbox">
				<label for="collapsible" class="lbl-toggle">Create an account and your first Organization.</label>
				<div class="collapsible-content">
				  <div class="content-inner">
					<p>
						<h2>Creating an Account</h2>
						
						<p>To gain access to LimaCharlie you will first need to create an account. This account can be attached to a specific email address (which will require you to verify the email), or through a Google, Github or Microsoft account.</p>
						
						<p>Head over to <a href="https://app.limacharlie.io/signup" target="_blank">app.limacharlie.io/signup</a> and follow the login instructions. If an email verification is required you will be prompted to do so.</p>
						
						<h2>Create an Organization</h2>
						 
						<p>The first time you login you will be presented with the <a href="https://www.limacharlie.io/terms" target="">Terms of Service</a>. Read through them and click accept.</p>

						<p>You will be presented with a welcome screen. At the bottom of this screen click "Create Organization". Clicking "Create Organization" opens a dialog to name the <em>Organization</em> and choose the location of the datacenter.</p>
						
						<h3>Select a Datacenter</h3>
						
						<p>Choose where you want your data to reside. Data does not transit outside of the geographical area in which the data center is located.</p>
						
						<p>The LimaCharlie global infrastructure is built on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and currently has computing resources available in the USA, Canada, Europe, India and the United Kingdom. Choosing a geographical location ensures data will always be processed in this location and never moved outside. New data centres can be spun up <a href="https://cloud.google.com/about/locations" target="_blank">anywhere GCP is available</a> upon customer request.</p>

						<h3>Give your organization a name.</h3>
						
						<p>The first thing to do is create an Organization. LimaCharlie is multi-tenant and the tenants are structured as Organizations. Sensors belong to Organizations and billing is performed per Organization.</p>

						<p>On the right side of the Member Organizations section of the dashboard, click on "Create".</p>

						<p>Select a datacenter. This will decide where your sensors will connect to in the world. Many countries are available. Enter an organization name. This name must be unique. The "Name Available" indicator should indicate a green checkbox a few seconds after you've entered a valid name.</p>

						<p>LimaCharlie comes with a free tier of two sensors. You do not need a credit card to get this free tier, but if you decide to upgrade your quota, you will have to enter your credit card information.</p>
						
						<p>Click "Create". Within a few seconds you should see an indication that your organization is ready.</p>

			<h3>Getting an Installation Key</h3>

			<p>To get started you will need to create an installation key. Installation keys can be created by visiting the <em>Installation Keys</em> section of the web application and clicking on the plus icon in the upper right corner.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/lc-edu/content/images/graphs/quickstart-installing-1.png"></p>

			<p>Once the key has been created copy it to your clipboard. Next visit the Sensor Downloads section of the web application and download the appropriate installer.</p>

			<p>Once the sensor is downloaded to the endpoint you will need to give it the appropriate permissions and use the installation key when executing.</p>

			<p>Installing the sensor requires administrator (or root) execution:</p>

		</br>

			<img style="float:left; max-width: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 10px;" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/lc-edu/content/images/graphs/quickstart-installing-2.png"/>
			<p><strong>Windows:</strong> installer.exe -i YOUR_INSTALLATION_KEY</p>

		</br>

			<img style="float:left; max-width: 20px; padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 10px;" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/lc-edu/content/images/graphs/quickstart-installing-3.png"/>
			<p><strong>MacOS:</strong> chmod +x installer ; installer -i YOUR_INSTALLATION_KEY</p>

		</br>

			<img style="float:left; max-width: 20px;  padding-top: 15px; padding-right: 10px;" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/lc-edu/content/images/graphs/quickstart-installing-4.png"/>
			<p><strong>Linux:</strong> chmod +x installer ; installer -d YOUR_INSTALLATION_KEY</p>

		</br>

			<p><strong>Note:</strong> On Linux the exact persistence mechanism, like launchd, is left to the administrator, therefore the -d argument launches the sensor from the current working directory without persistence. The sensor does not daemonize itself.</p>

			<p>If you wish to remove the sensor from the endpoint you can do so by running the installer with the <code>-c</code> flag.</p>

			<p>A sample script for setting up persistence on Linux systems that utilize init.d can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/refractionPOINT/lce_doc/blob/master/docs/lc_linux_installer.sh" target="_blank">init.d</a></p>

			<p>A sample script for setting up persistence on Linux systems that utilize systemd can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/refractionPOINT/lce_doc/blob/master/scripts/lc_systemd_installer.sh" target="_blank">systemd</a></p>

			<p>Once the sensor is installed it should show up in the Sensors section of the web application. To see the Sensor View for a specific <a href="https://doc.limacharlie.io/docs/documentation/docs/events.md" target="_blank">Device</a> click the hostname from this list.</p>

			<div class="wrap-collabsible">
				<input id="collapsible2" class="toggle" type="checkbox">
				<label for="collapsible2" class="lbl-toggle">Details on the Sensor View.</label>
				<div class="collapsible-content">
				  <div class="content-inner">

					<h2>Sensor Details</h2>
					
					<p>To view the endpoint details click on the hostname in the sensor list on the Sensor page.</p>

					<p>This view provides us with a window into the endpoint where we can take a host of actions or perform investigations. A listing of the various menu items, along with a brief description of each is as follows.</p>
