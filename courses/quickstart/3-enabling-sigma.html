            <h2>The Sigma Rule Set</h2>

            <p>Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) uses rules to discover and take action against malicious behaviour. LimaCharlie uses its own YAML-based language to express Detection & Response (DR) rules and can also leverage existing community-based formats such as YARA and Sigma.</p>

            

            <p>In this lesson we are going to deploy a mirror of the official Sigma rule set which will enable solid coverage across the entire fleet. Later in the lesson we will show you how to create False Positive rules.</p>
            
            <p>The Sigma rule set is an open source signature format that can describe relevant log events in a straightforward manner. The rule format itself is very flexible and applicable to any type of log file. The main purpose of Sigma is to provide a structured form with which researchers and analysts can describe and share detection methods with the wider community.</p>
