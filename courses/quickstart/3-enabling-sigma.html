            <h2>The Sigma Rule Set</h2>

            <p>Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) uses rules to discover and take action against malicious behaviour. LimaCharlie uses its own YAML-based language to express Detection & Response (DR) rules and can also leverage existing community-based formats such as YARA and Sigma.</p>

            <p>The focus of this lesson is to get the user setup with <a href="https://github.com/refractionPOINT/rules/tree/master/Sigma" target="_blank">basic Sigma rule</a> coverage across all endpoints. To do so we are going to deploy a mirror of the official Sigma rule. Later in the lesson we will show you how to create False Positive rules.</p>

                    <h3>Detection & Response Rules</h3>

                    <p>Detection & Response rules are designed to allow you to push out a detection rule and with a custom action in record time. Think of them like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions. They can be added and removed with single operations and they become immediately available/running as they are set.</p>

                    <p>A D&R rule has two components:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>The detection part of the rule is a simple expression that describes what the rule should match on.</li>
                        <li>The response part of the rule describes the list of actions that should be taken when the rule matches.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The REST interface expects those rules in their native JSON format (as described below), but UIs to generate this format are available if you are uncomfortable with the JSON.</p>

                    <p>For more sample rules and guidelines around rule writing, see our public repository dedicated to this purpose.</p>

                    <p>The website version of this (on limacharlie.io) takes the rules as YAML to make them easier to visualize.</p>

                    <p>Full documentation can be <a href="https://doc.limacharlie.io/docs/documentation/docs/dr.md" target="_blank">found here</a>.</p>

            <p>The Sigma rule set is an open source signature format that can describe relevant log events in a straightforward manner. The rule format itself is very flexible and applicable to any type of log file. The main purpose of Sigma is to provide a structured form with which researchers and analysts can describe and share detection methods with the wider community.</p>

                    Monetizing Products with LimaCharlie
                    LimaCharlie is partnering with develoeprs on a case-by-case basis to enable them to sell their products or services in the LimaCharlie Marketplace using a revenu share model. We have had several success using this model and are eager to develop the program further. Some of the succesful products thus far are as follows.

                    <p>The Cutting Edge threat feeds are aggregated, filtered and augmented from a multitude of sources.</p>

                    <p>Emphasis is put on timely Indicators of Compromise (IoC) for new and upcoming threats.</p>

                    <p>Produced detections are made more powerful for operations by including a lot of metadata around the origin of the IoC as well as the nature of the threat which provides pre-emptive investigation data.</p>

                    <p>A "sentiment" metric is also included to help you dial in the level of certainty you want to receive alerts for.</p>
