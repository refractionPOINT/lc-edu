			<p>LimaCharlie also offers an integration with VirusTotal. If you do not already have an account with VirusTotal, you will have to create one and get an API key.</p>

			<p>Once you have created an account find the API key.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>The free tier of VirusTotal allows four lookups per minute via the API.</p>

			<p>Note:&nbsp;LimaCharlie employs a global cache of all VirusTotal requests which should significantly reduce your costs if you are using VirusTotal at scale.</p>

			<p>Once you have your VirusTotal API key you can add it to the integrations section of the LimaCharlie web app.</p>

			<p>Once you have entered your API key, you can then create a DR rule to let you know if there is a hit from VirusTotal on a file with more than two different engines saying it is bad.</p>

			<p>Once again the response component of this rule is left up to the user to exercise.</p>
