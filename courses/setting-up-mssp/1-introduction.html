            <p>This course outlines best practices for the most efficient use of LimaCharlie at scale. This structure is ideal for a Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) or Security Operations Center (SOC) that is managing multiple organizations but offers many benefits to all classes of LimaCharlie users.</p>

            <p>LimaCharlie provides full control over its technology. With this control LimaCharlie users are able to adapt to a wide variety of environments and technologies. This permissive approach is extremely powerful and also why the way that deployments are structured is important so that users can avoid problems as they scale.</p>

            <p>The architectural approach outlined in this course will not only help avoid issues at scale but will also provide a scaffold which makes it easy to onboard new customer organizations.</p>
