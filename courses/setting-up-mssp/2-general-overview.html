            <p>LimaCharlie users are in full control of how they leverage the technology. To this end, it is in the user's best interest to utilize proven patterns for managing their security infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Everything that LimaCharlie can do can be controlled through the web application and conversely everything that the web application can do can be accomplished with the API.</p>

            <p>Managed security providers that are just getting established will likely want to run the majority of their operations through the web application. From this initial footing new users can grow into the use of the API as they develop specialized capabilities or integrations with other tools.</p>

            <p>Security providers with existing pipelines will likely want to start by leveraging the API to add capabilities or replace existing technologies.</p> 

            <p>Regardless of how the technological capabilities of LimaCharlie are leveraged the structural approach outlined in this course will offer benefit.</p>
