            <p>LimaCharlie users are in full control of how they leverage the technology. To this end, it is in the users' best interest to utilize proven patterns for managing their security infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Everything that LimaCharlie can do can be controlled through the web application and conversely everything that the web applicaiton can do can be accomplished with the API.</p>

            <p>Managed security providers that are just getting established will likely want to run the majority of thier operations through the web application and grow into the use of the API as they develop sepcialized capabilities or integrations with other tools.</p>

            <p>Security providers with existing pipelines will likely want to start by leveraging the API to add capabiliteies or replace exisiting technologies.</p> 

            <p>Regardless of how the technological capabilities of LimaChalrie are leveraged the structual approach outlined in this course will offer benefit.</p>
