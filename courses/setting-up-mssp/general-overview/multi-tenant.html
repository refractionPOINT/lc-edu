            LimaCharlie is multi-tenant by design. A LimaCharlie user can create multiple tenants with each one defined as an organization. An organization represents the endpoint agents, strorage and infrastructure used to provide security services to a single client company or group. This architecture ensures that everything is siloed and provides a lot of benefit when managing a large number of organizations.

            The LimaCharlie user that creates an organization is the admin account by default but the two are not tied together forever. A LimaCharlie user may belong to multiple organizations and have varying levels of permissions and access for each.
