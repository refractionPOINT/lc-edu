            <p>There are two types of API keys available with LimaCharlie.</p> 

            <p>Org Level API Key</p>
            <ul>
                <li>An org level API key only applies to the specific organization it was created for and the permissions can be set per-key. That is, an unlimited number if keys with vastly different permissions can be created per organization.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>User Level API Key </p>
            <ul>
                <li>A user level API key can be applied to all organizations and permissions that the given user has. That is to say, user API keys that are created automatically inherit the permissions of the user that is creating them. These keys are powerful and should be used cautiously.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Because LimaCharlie is multi-tenant it is advantageous to create a special CI/CD user account on LimaCharlie to use for orchestrating. For our purposes we will refer to this account as the root account.</p>
