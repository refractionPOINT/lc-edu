            <p>In this video series, Maxime Lamothe-Brassard talks about LimaCharlie's powerful ability to capture and analyze Windows Event Logs (WEL) in real-time. Ingested WEL are indexed along common indicators of compromise (IoC's) and run through the LimaCharlie Detection & Response (DR) engine. DR rules can be run against artifacts as they are ingested or even across historical data.</p>
